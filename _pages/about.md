#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at University of Southern California. My supervisor is [Dr. Danny JJ Wang] (https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Wang/Danny) and my research focus is in technical development of arterial spin labeling (ASL)and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and improving ASL with Deep learning techniques.

During my Ph.D. training, I learned skill of MRI sequence development (on Siemens IDEA platform, with C++ coding), image reconstruction and processing with MATLAB, as well as deep learning development using various data (especially on Keras and Pytorch platforms)


For my hobbies, I love basketball and tennis. 
I'm a fan of Los Angeles Lakers!
